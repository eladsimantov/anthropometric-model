# Anthropometric Model for MATLAB
## Disclaimer
This class was developed with significant assistance from AI tools to accelerate a research project. 
As such, it has not undergone extensive testing. Use at your own risk!

## About The Project

This MATLAB class implements anthropometric data based on David Winter's Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Movement Anthropometric Data (Table 4.1). 
By inputting basic dimensions such as total height and mass, the model calculates segment lengths, masses, centers of mass, radii of gyration, and other biomechanical parameters for the whole body.

This toolbox is designed to facilitate biomechanical modeling, human movement analysis, and ergonomic studies by providing a ready-to-use anthropometric data interface.

## Features

- Input total body height and mass to compute segment parameters  
- Calculates lengths, masses, centers of mass, radii of gyration, and moments of inertia  
- Implements widely used anthropometric proportions from David Winter's book  
- Easy to integrate into MATLAB projects and biomechanical simulations  
- Example scripts included for quick start

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
